To Do:
	Integrate with backend
	Implement login script (Computer was giving me issues, gotta figure out why)
	Improve Chatbot
	Make submit button only work when all fields are filled for respective field (or make it so you must fill out everything before moving to the next part and just have submit always enabled) and popup with success window

Minor CSS Improvements to be done:
  	User and help icons are placeholders. Will replace in future.
   	Fix Carme logo (looks low quality) also prevents navbar from properly shrinking based on window size (might need to change it to text, gotta find proper font)
   	Get better help pic
   	Make form shrink dynamically with window (navbar has weird white block that you click to see the links and the text changes with the browser size but not the forms and buttons)
	Mess with chatbot design
	Mess with help css
	Mess with radio button css
	Move all inline css to css file
	Change button colors when selected
