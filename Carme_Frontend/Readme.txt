To Do: Figure out how to implement Chatbot and customize its UI

Notes: User and help icons are placeholders. Will replace in future.
	   Fix Carme logo (looks low quality) also prevents navbar from properly shrinking based on window size (might need to change it to text, gotta find proper font)
	   Get better help pic
	   Get help button with popup user modal working
	   Make form shrink dynamically with window
	   Get form to match mockup (had to change the design to get working in a timely manner for testing)
	   
	  
	  
Need to organize and doucment code!
